std::vector<bool> is a specialized container in C++ that's often the source of subtle bugs due to its non-standard implementation. Unlike other vector types, it doesn't store bool values directly but uses bit manipulation for memory optimization. This leads to unexpected behavior when interacting with it using iterators or algorithms that assume a standard container layout.
